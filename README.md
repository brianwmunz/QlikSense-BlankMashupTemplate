QlikSense-BlankMashupTemplate
================
All this template does is allow you to create a completely blank mashup project.  The only reason I made it is because we don't have it offered by default, so I think it may be useful.  Once you add this to the proper folder, you will see it appear in the list of workbench templates as "Totally Blank Template."  This is really only useful in getting your mashup assigned to a QVF and available in the list of workbench extensions.

Installation & Use

Simply take this folder and add it to C:\Users\[YOUR USER NAME]\Documents\Qlik\Sense\Extensions\Templates.
Once you do this you should see the new template appear in the dropdown list after clicking the "Create New" button.
